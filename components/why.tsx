            At actualwork, we believe in the power of transparency and
            community. We believe that by sharing our journey of building a
            product in public, we can inspire others to do the same, and we can
            all learn from one another.
            <br /> <br />
            Our manifesto is simple: we will provide a platform for people to
            share their journey of building a product in real-time, and we will
            foster a community of like-minded individuals who support each other
            in their endeavors.
            <br /> <br />
            We will not shy away from the challenges and failures that
            inevitably come with building a product. Instead, we will embrace
            them, and we will use them as opportunities to learn and grow. We
            will be honest and open about our progress, and we will invite
            others to hold us accountable.
            <br /> <br />
            We believe that by sharing our journey with the world, we can create
            a more collaborative and innovative environment, and we can inspire
            others to pursue their dreams of building a product. Join us on this
            journey, and let's{" "}
